### Sampling rate

 By default, Session Replay captures 0% of sessions for replay. Use the `sampleRate` configuration option to set the percentage of total sessions that Session Replay captures. For example:

```js
// This configuration samples 40% of all sessions
await sessionReplay.init(AMPLITUDE_API_KEY, {
  sampleRate: 0.4
}).promise;
```

To set the `sampleRate` consider the monthly quota on your Session Replay plan. For example, if your monthly quota is 2,500,000 sessions, and you average 3,000,000 monthly sessions, your quota is 83% of your average sessions. In this case, to ensure sampling lasts through the month, set `sampleRate` to `.83` or lower.

Keep the following in mind as you consider your sample rate:

- When you reach your monthly session quota, Amplitude stops capturing sessions for replay.
- Session quotas reset on the first of every month.
- Use sample rate to distribute your session quota over the course of a month, rather than using your full quota at the beginning of the month.
