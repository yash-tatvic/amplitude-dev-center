!!!warning "Id length limit"
    The maintenance SDK uses an old SDK endpoint (`api2.amplitude.com`) which enforces no length limit for `deviceId` and `userId`. The latest SDK uses Amplitude's HTTP V2 API (`api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`) and requires identifiers to be at least 5 characters by default. When you migrate to the latest SDK, set `config.minIdLength` to a smaller value if you allowed identifiers with fewer than 5 characters.
