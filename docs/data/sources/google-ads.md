Amplitude Data's Google Ads integration lets you import your Google Ad spend, click, and impression data in just a few steps.

!!!note "Other Amplitude + Google Ads Integrations"

    This integration imports Google Ads data into Amplitude. Amplitude offers other integrations with Google Ads:

    - [Send Cohorts to Google Ads](/data/destinations/google-ads-cohort)

## Setup

### Prerequisites

To set up, you need the following:

- [Google Ads Customer ID](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/1704344?hl=en) of the ad account you want to connect to.
- If you don't have direct access to the account, `Google Ads Manager ID` that you authorized access on which can view this ad account.

### Considerations

- This source imports **metrics data** from Google Ads. It doesn't import other types of data, like experiments.
- Amplitude's Google Ads integration imports data from Google Ads **once a day**, so your Daily Ad Metrics populates all at once. Check the time of the next sync in the settings.
- The advertising data you import is associated with a new Amplitude event called `Daily Ad Metrics`. This event has several event properties, like `Ad Impressions`, `Ad Clicks`, and `Ad Group ID`. For more information, see [Ad-Network Integrations in Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/blog/ad-network-integration)
- Google Ads import pulls data and clicks on a **per-ad** level. The advertising metrics and properties aren't tied to users and display along with the `Display Ad Metrics` event. Therefore, `Daily Ads Metric` events might be the only event showing up in your users' event stream.

### Amplitude setup

In Amplitude, navigate to **Data Sources**, then find **Google Ad** in the **I want to import data into Amplitude** tab.

## Common issues

### Insufficient permissions

Amplitude's Google Ads Import integration requires that your Google Ads Manager account has administrator privileges. This level of permission allows Amplitude to add and remove users from specific user lists in Google Ads. 
For more information, see [About access levels in your Google Ads Account](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9978556) in Google's documentation. 

### Import job ingests no data 

1. Check if you reject unplanned events in your [Schema settings](https://help.amplitude.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055495852-Configure-the-Schema-settings-to-handle-unexpected-data). If you reject unplanned data,  Amplitude doesn't store the event or its properties.
2. Do your users have corresponding accounts in Amplitude and Google Ads? Google Ads import tries to match users between platforms based on the key-value pairs you selected. If your import job doesn't find any corresponding values, it fails.

### Daily ad metric discrepancies 

Your metrics may occasionally update days after a click occurs. This can happen for many  reasons, including but not limited to:
- When a conversion occurs days after the initial click
- When the source detects and removes invalid traffic
Hence, if Google updates the data afterward - the import job will have to run again to get the updated numbers.
